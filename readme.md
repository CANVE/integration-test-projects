The projects included in this repo will be used by [the integration testing project](https://github.com/CANVE/extractor/tree/master/sbt-plugin-test-lib) for its testing.

It contains: 
+ projects created specifically for it
+ links to publicly available git projects

The latter kind is linked as [git submodules](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-submodule), rather than copied in, which comes with some conveniences and some annoyances alike.
