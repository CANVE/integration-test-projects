This repo simply houses and links to other projects. The projects included in this repo will be used by [for integration testing](https://github.com/CANVE/extractor/tree/master/sbt-plugin-test-lib). As such, this repo comprises:

+ Projects created specifically for integration testing.
+ Links to publicly available git projects, useful for integration testing. These are linked as [git submodules](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-submodule), rather than copied in, which comes with some conveniences and some annoyances alike.
